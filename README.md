# OpenCV-facerecognition
This is to display openCV's face recognition. Make sure to add the paths for your own image and classifier.

It uses basic elements to detect and make a box around faces. 

NOTE: You may need to adjust the minNeighbors factor if it detects that are not faces or if it detects none.
